![FlowNote](docs/images/logo.png)

FlowNote lets developers create, organize, and reason about event-oriented applications with a simple flow-based language.

FlowNote has a bunch of [features](docs/07-features.md) to help reason about and represent many common problems with event-driven development. [Check out the documentation](https://emblem21-opensource.github.io/flownote/) to get started.

We also have a [Gitter](https://gitter.im/flownote/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) if you prefer to ask specific questions and visit our tiny but growing community.
