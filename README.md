FlowNote is an engine to create, organize, inspect, visualize, and hook into event-oriented applications with a language that makes reasoning about flow-based paradigms easy.  

FlowNote has many [features](docs/07-features.md) and solves many common problems with event-driven architecture. [Check our documentation](https://emblem21-opensource.github.io/flownote/) to get a more comprehensive understanding how how to use it.
