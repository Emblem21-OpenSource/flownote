# The Application Concept

Applications contain Flows (which represent your business logic.) and an Event Queue (for Event progression).

## Event Queue

The Event Queue receives Events from Nodes, Milestones, and Channels and properly executes the Actions within each.

## Examples

To see more isolated examples, check out the [flowExamples.js](tests/flowExamples.js) test.
