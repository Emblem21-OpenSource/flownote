# The Flow Concept

Flows contain Nodes and Milestones that are connected together via Channels. Flows can also connect to Flows to maximize reuse of business logic.

## Configuring

* `showState` will show the consolidated state of all transformations that applied to the Request when `request.asResult` is called.
* `showTrace` will show all transitions between Nodes, Milestones, and Channels the Request made when `request.asResult` is called.
* `showChanges` will show all changes made to the Request when `request.asResult` is called.

## Examples
